# scRNA-seq_Tutorial

This repository contains the pre-processing and analysis steps for scRNA-seq (single cell RNA-seq) data.

The data for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells (NSCLC) is freely available from 10X Genomics (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-vdj/datasets/2.2.0/vdj_v1_hs_nsclc_5gex).

The repository has scRNA.R (a R script for the analysis of scRNA data), which has been incorporated in scRNA.sh (which has pre-processing steps of the original data).

The Rscript has all the processes and steps defined with a "#", for the user's convenience. 

All the image files (heatmaps, plots, and others) generated from the R script have been provided here.
